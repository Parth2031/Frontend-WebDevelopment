  <h1>Async vs Defer:</h1>
  <h2>Undestanding Difference between Async and Defer in Script Tag</h2>
  <p id = "first">It helps to load the script tag quickly.</p>
  <p id = "second"><strong class = "size">Async means:</strong> The browser loads whatever HTML, CSS, and other JavaScript are in the .html file while it is downloading the
  external .js file with async, and loads the .js file once they finish downloading.</p>
  <p id = "third"><strong class = "size">Defer means:</strong> The browser loads whatever HTML, CSS, and other JavaScript are in the .html file while it is downloading the external
  .js file with defer. But it only loads the .js file after the rest HTML, CSS, other JavaScripts without defer, and other
  JavaScripts with defer that goes before the current JavaScript is loaded.</p>
  <p class = "main"><strong class = "other">Syntax of Script Tag with async: </strong> script src = "..." async /script</p>
  <p class = "main"><strong class = "other">Syntax of Script Tag with defer: </strong> script src = "..." defer /script</p>
