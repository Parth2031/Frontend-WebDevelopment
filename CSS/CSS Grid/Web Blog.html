        Grandfather's creaky as front porch, loads his shotgun beneath the awning, spittoon restless for rain, carpenter's chair against the whistling air.
        Rocking, back and forth, roching snap shot picture - worth it, just like the movies.

        She said that he loved baseball' and James Earl Jones; said that he's got good talking inside of his thoughts while he's rounding those bases on his way back home.

        You've got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like you're tied to a slave master's cruel hand, and it's the same pain that drives that oppressor's heart of stone, so you've grown to love the man.
        You keep pouring yourself out, again and again,into legible lines through a crokked pen.
        "Yeah, it's painful, butr it's familiar - so habit breeds comfort, and I don't know what I'd do without him."

        So in the early morning, when you've fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I've claimed as of my own, and wonder if tonight will be a night 
        I'll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all.

        In a perfect world, we'll have albums labelled Seasons, with chapter heading's, and we'll staple them to the cork board that hangs at the foot foot of the bed.
        There's longevityin a memory split out in pen, and if a picture is worth a thousand words then I've written down every one of them.
