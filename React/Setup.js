// TODO:: Understanding React Setup, Syntax & Terms :-

/*
! Explanation of React Terms - 

? React is a Javascript Library for building user interface. User Interface are Components which are Custom HTML Elements.


? React Components can be created by two ways -> 
* 1st way : Using App.js file as the Main File but is used to create small projects as it could create confusion.
* 2nd way : Creating .jsx files as it works like Modular Javascript for handling multiple files using import and export keywords.

! NOTE on JSX (Javascript Extension) Files ->>

? Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
? For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.
